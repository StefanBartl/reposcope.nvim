---@module 'reposcope.ui.actions.status_view'
---@brief Renders `:Reposcope status` results and displays them in the user's chosen output.
---@description
--- `vim.notify` truncates and can't be scrolled, which makes it a poor fit for
--- a repository-status overview that can easily run to dozens of lines. This
--- module renders the aligned status table once and then hands it to one of
--- several output backends, all built on `lib.nvim`:
---   - "popup"     (default) a scrollable floating window via `lib.nvim.ui.kit`
---   - "buffer"    replaces the current window's buffer with the status buffer
---   - "split"     opens (or reuses) a horizontal split
---   - "vsplit"    opens (or reuses) a vertical split
---   - "clipboard" copies the raw table to the system clipboard
---   - "path"      writes the raw table to a file
---
--- On every interactive backend (popup/buffer/split/vsplit), the repository row
--- under the cursor can be opened: `<CR>` or a double-click (`<2-LeftMouse>`)
--- asks for confirmation via `lib.nvim.ui.kit`'s button-confirm dialog, then
--- opens that repository's `README.md` (`:edit`). Rows with no readable
--- `README.md` are a silent no-op past a notification — there is nothing to
--- confirm opening.
---
--- The same row also drives git itself: `p`/`P`/`f` push, pull (`--ff-only`)
--- or fetch the repository under the cursor via `utils.repo_actions`. Each
--- action reports success/failure via notification and then re-reads just
--- that repository's status (`utils.repo_status.status_one`) and redraws the
--- table in place, so ahead/behind counts and dirty state stay current
--- without re-scanning the whole directory. A one-line legend of these keys
--- is shown in the window's `winbar`.
---
--- Those same three keys are also the batch: `m` marks the row under the
--- cursor (or, over a Visual selection, every row it spans) and while
--- anything is marked `p`/`P`/`f` act on the marked set instead of on one
--- row. That is one key doing one thing at two scales, rather than a second
--- uppercase alphabet of batch verbs nobody would find -- and it is why a
--- mark is stored by repository path: `s` re-sorts and `R` re-scans, and a
--- mark that followed the row index would quietly end up on a different
--- repository.
---
--- `gp`/`gP`/`gf`/`gu` are the whole-directory forms, ignoring marks: push,
--- pull, fetch, or update (fetch + ff-only pull, the same pair
--- `:Reposcope update` runs) every repository in the overview. Batches run
--- sequentially and report through `utils.progress` -- these are network
--- calls, and forty simultaneous pushes are a rate limit or an auth-prompt
--- storm -- and every batch is confirmed first, because unlike a single row
--- there is nothing on screen that says what is about to be touched.

---One highlight span produced by `M.render`. Rows and columns are 0-indexed
---byte offsets; `end_col = -1` means "to the end of the line".
